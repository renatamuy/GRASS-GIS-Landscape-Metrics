# GRASS Landscape Metrics
Landscape Metrics in GRASS GIS

## LS Metrics
Patch-based spatial analysis system (*r.pi*) integrated natively into a Free and Open Source GIS (*GRASS GIS*) to be able to analyse large amounts of satellite derived land cover data in a semi-automatic manner, and to ensure high reproducibility and robustness (Wegmann et al. 2017).

## r.li
Toolset for multiscale analysis of landscape structure ([*r.li*](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.li.html#references)). It aims at implementing metrics as found in external software for quantitative measures of landscape structure like FRAGSTATS ([McGarigal and Marks 1995](https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/gtr_351.pdf), ).
