# GRASS GIS Landscape Metrics
Landscape Metrics in GRASS GIS

## LSMetrics
[LSMetrics](https://github.com/LEEClab/LS_METRICS) is a software designed to calculate ecologically based landscape metrics and landscape statistics, as well as generate maps of landscape connectivity. Also, the software is designed to prepare maps and enviroment for running BioDIM, an individual-based model of animal movement in fragmented landscapes. The software runs in a GRASS GIS (currently GRASS GIS 7.0.x) environment and uses raster images as input.

## r.pi
Patch-based spatial analysis system (*r.pi*) integrated natively into a Free and Open Source GIS (*GRASS GIS*) to be able to analyse large amounts of satellite derived land cover data in a semi-automatic manner, and to ensure high reproducibility and robustness (Wegmann et al. 2017).

## r.li
Toolset for multiscale analysis of landscape structure ([*r.li*](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.li.html#references)). It aims at implementing metrics as found in external software for quantitative measures of landscape structure like FRAGSTATS (McGarigal and Marks 1995).
